News is buzzing in Mombasa claiming that Diamond Platnumz could be a persona non grata in the city’s entertainment circles. This decision was reached after the Tanzanian hearthrob is reported to have infuriated one of the county staff during a recent showbiz shindig in Mombasa. Apparently, the Number One star snubbed a county staff who wanted to get information from him during the event. According to a source who sought anonymity, “The staff was disturbed by Diamond’s reaction and had to cancel the deal they wanted to extend to him. “In fact they had earlier communicated with his management about it and the celeb was to sign the deal after a one-on-one conversation.” Speaking about the alleged snub, Mombasa county tourism executive member Joab Tumbo refuted claims that there is any conflict with any artiste. Diamond, whose mother Sanura ‘Sandra’ Kassim, is hospitalised in India after allegations of being bewitched, is said to have made numerous calls to the county staff inquiring about the deal but his calls went unanswered. The Ukimwona star’s mother was rushed to India for medical attention after she was allegedly attacked by jinns a few days ago, according to numerous reports emerging from Tanzania. It is alleged the jinns were meant to cause harm to Diamond but luckily he survived. Diamond’s close friend, who did not want to be named, told Word Is that Diamond is in “shock over his mother’s condition”. Called for comment, Diamond did not wish to comment on the alleged snub. “I can’t talk much about that now but let’s keep praying, that’s all I can say.”
