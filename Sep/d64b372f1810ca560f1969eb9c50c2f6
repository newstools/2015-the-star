Three women have surprised Murang’a town residents when they agreed to marry one man. Freshia Nyambura is married and Agnes Wambui and Esther Nyaguthii will be married to Charles Mwangi. Mwangi said it is not wrong to have three wives. Many men are married to one wife but have mpango wa kando, he said. Mwangi said it is better to have such relationships in the open, than hide with other women behind the wife’s back. Wambui and Nyaguthii arranged the dowry payment ceremony for Nyambura, the first wife. Speaking at the event in Murang’a town on Sunday, Mwangi said he will not reveal details about his family’s affairs. Wambui and Nyaguthii said after Mwangi is done with the first dowry, they will plan the second and third.
