Kenyans are today commemorate the anniversary of the deaths of Internal Security Minister George Saitoti and three other public figures in two plane crashes. On June 10, 2012, Internal Security Minister George Saitoti and Assistant Minister Joshua Orwa Ojode died in a police helicopter crash in Kibiku, Ngong Forest. Their bodyguards and the two pilots also died. On June 10, 2008, a small plane crash claimed the lives of Home Affairs Assistant Minister and Sotik MP Lorna Laboso and Minister of Roads and Bomet MP Kipkalya Kones. The pilot and a security official also died when Cessna aircraft crashed into a building in Kojong’a market in Narok on its way to Kericho. Kones and Laboso, then members of ODM, were heading to Ainamoi to campaign for ODM candidate Benjamim Langat in a by-election. Commemorations have been held annually at their homes in Sotik and Kaporuso. Lorna’s sister Joyce Laboso, who is the National Assembly Deputy Speaker became MP for the Sotik constituency. Beatrice Kones was elected Bomet MP following her husband’s death. “Today we have decided that this time round we shall have brief prayers to remember our beloved husband and father who was an exemplary leader. There will be little celebrations since we have not involved various leaders,” she said. She spoke to the Star on phone yesterday. Lorna’s memorial takes place at Lorna Laboso Girls Secondary School in Sotik where leaders are expected to attend. Dr Laboso is away on official duty in Fiji. “We are expecting a number of leaders to attend the event to remember a well-lived life of our family member, Lorna Laboso,” one relative said.
