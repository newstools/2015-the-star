SINGER Avril has no plans to relocate to South Africa or anywhere else after going down the aisle with her South African beau. In an interview with Word Is, the Nikimuona-singer said that it matters less where the two, who are set to solemnise their union in a few months, will settle, but “wherever it is going to be must be the place where there is money for us”. “For us, we will be comfortable with a place that will offer us a chance to raise our children in a better way. A place where we can build our future together. It might be here in Kenya or South Africa, or somewhere else, as long as it's the place where we will be getting money,” she says. Avril added that the date for their big day is yet to be set but preparations are on top gear. Nevertheless, there is still a dilemma on where the wedding will be held. She said: “We are still not decided whether to have it in Kenya or down South, or still to have two ceremonies in both countries. But either way, our parents and other family members are content and ready to agree to whatever the decision that we make about that. They all understand our situation.” Avril — who was among Ogopa Deejays-signed artistes whose contracts “ran out” last year — says that she values her freedom and she is feeling more ambitious working as a freelance artiste. “For now, I am not ready to commit to any record label. I am trying to work with different producers and I am liking it. I love my freedom an I am feeling very ambitious as a freelancer,” she said.
