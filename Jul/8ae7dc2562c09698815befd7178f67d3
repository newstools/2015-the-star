WHEN Chelsea FC manager Jose Mourinho visited Kenya in 2010, he is said to have fallen in love with a young Kenyan lady in Diani. Fast forward five years later and the lady in question Lelesit Silvana is opening up on what transpired between her and the then Real Madrid FC coach. According to one of her close family members – who spoke with Word Is and sought anonymity – Silvana was offered marriage by the self-proclaimed “Special One”. The Portuguese, who has enjoyed an illustrious career in football management across Europe, is said to have allegedly committed himself to divorce his wife Matilde Faria for his new Kenyan flame. The source said that Silvana has since made several visits to Poland where they both met and had “fun and Mourinho was ready for anything”. “He is so deeply in love with her. We have seen several email chats and witnessed uncountable night calls between them,” said our source who also availed to us exclusive travel receipts confirming visits to Europe. Silvana, who is currently dating a Kenyan-Somali, is said to be pondering her next move regarding the issue. “When the right time comes, the whole world will know the whole truth,” she told us when reached for a comment. During his holiday in Diani, Silvana sold Mourinho a Tanzanite bracelet worth Sh500,000, which she dutifully shipped to Poland. This reportedly helped make their trust stronger. Mourinho stayed at the prestigious Almanara Luxury Villas in Diani with his wife and two children, Jose Mario Mourinho Jr. and Matilde Mourinho.
